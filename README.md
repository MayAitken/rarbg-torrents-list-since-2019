## Selling 2,100 Terabytes of RARBG torrent content since 2019

[magnets-links.txt](https://github.com/MayAitken/rarbg-torrents-list-since-2019/blob/main/torrents-list-with-size.txt)

Hello fellow Pirates,

I have downloaded 387,180 torrents content (2.1 Petabytes) of RARBG Torrents since 2019 for the categories distributed among a few servers.
- TV Series (including HD, 4K, HDR, SDR)
- Movies (including HD, 4K, HDR, SDR)
- PC Games
- Music 

With the content I also have all the `.torrent` files for them, a simple mysql table with the list of `Torrent Hash, Name, Size, List of Files`.

It has costed me thounands of dollars to run the download servers and I am going to delete them as RARBG is no more.

I can transfer all 2.1 Petabytes of torrents content to any servers, Google Drive, or any Cloud Storage.

### If anyone is interested, email me at MayAitken@proton.me

I'm not admin of RARBG and download these torrents through an automated system, I'm looking to make some bucks before getting rid of the expensive servers.
